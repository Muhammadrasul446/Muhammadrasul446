I hate Python, but i use it. Unfortunately, i have to use it. Most of my projects use python. But i hate python. It's awful:

1. No static-typing. Actually there's some, but it isn't checked.
2. No interfaces. In almost everything I make, I use interfaces. But there are no interfaces in python.
3. No proper encapsulation. How can you make fields of a class private? I need it.
4. No abstraction. Again - How can you make fields of a class private?
5. No constants! No constants?! Seriuous?
6. What the hell? Where is my ++? Give it to me!

Guido van Rossum - can you explain the above things?
