I hate Python, but i use it. Unfortunately, i have to use it. Most of my projects use python. But i hate python. It awful:

1. No static-typing. Actually there's some, but it isn't checked.
2. No interfaces. In almost everything i make, i use interfaces. But there are no such in python.
3. No proper encapsulation. How can you make fields of a class private? I need it.
4. No abstraction. Again - How can you make fields of a class private?
5. No constants. No constants! No constants?! Seriuous?
6. No constructor. Where the hell is it? Only initializer.
7. What the hell? Where is my ++? Give it to me!
